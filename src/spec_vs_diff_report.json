  "summary": "The diff implements mobile scrolling fixes and touch optimization improvements across multiple components. Key changes include CSS modifications for scroll behavior, touch-action properties, momentum scrolling on iOS, and tap-target classes for better touch interaction. However, comprehensive mobile compatibility testing (REQ-14) is not evidenced in the diff.",

      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "Perform comprehensive mobile compatibility verification testing across all major features to ensure the application functions correctly on mobile devices, including navigation, authentication, video playback, form submission, and interactive elements",
      "reason": "The diff shows implementation changes but provides no evidence of testing or verification. No test files, test reports, or documentation of testing results are included. The requirement explicitly calls for 'verification testing' with specific acceptance criteria about authentication completion, video playback controls, form submission, and service worker loading - none of which are verified in the diff.",
