  "summary": "The diff implements most mobile debugging and infrastructure improvements (REQ-7, REQ-10, REQ-11, REQ-12), but lacks explicit implementation of authentication flow fixes (REQ-8) and comprehensive touch event handler verification (REQ-9). Some mobile optimizations are present but evidence for complete touch event handling across all interactive elements is insufficient in the truncated diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Fix Internet Identity authentication flow for mobile browsers, ensuring the redirect URL handling works correctly and users can complete login on mobile devices",
      "reason": "No modifications to authentication components, Internet Identity integration logic, or redirect URL handling are evident in the diff. The ErrorBoundary mentions 'auth' error categorization but does not implement authentication flow fixes.",
      "evidence": []

    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Verify and fix touch event handlers across all interactive elements including buttons, cards, navigation links, video controls, and dialog overlays to ensure they respond properly to mobile touch inputs",
      "reason": "While CSS utilities add tap-target classes and touch-action styles, the diff does not show verification or fixes to specific interactive components like video controls, card touch handlers, or dialog overlays. Evidence is limited to general CSS utilities without component-level implementation.",
