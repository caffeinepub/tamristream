# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Diagnose and fix complete mobile functionality failure preventing the application from working on mobile devices.

**Planned changes:**
- Investigate and fix critical JavaScript errors preventing app loading on mobile browsers
- Fix Internet Identity authentication flow for mobile devices (redirect URL handling and login completion)
- Verify and fix touch event handlers for all interactive elements (buttons, cards, navigation, video controls, dialogs)
- Fix mobile viewport rendering issues (scaling, scroll behavior, layout overflow)
- Test and fix service worker caching strategy on mobile browsers
- Add comprehensive mobile device debugging capability (error logging, network monitoring, device info display)

**User-visible outcome:** The application loads and functions completely on mobile devices. Users can authenticate via Internet Identity, navigate the app, interact with all buttons and controls using touch, and view content properly on mobile screens.
