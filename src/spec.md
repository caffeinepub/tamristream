# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Optimize TamriStream for low-bandwidth African markets with adaptive streaming, data usage tracking, and PWA capabilities.

**Planned changes:**
- Add low-bandwidth mode toggle with automatic quality adjustment (240p to 1080p) based on connection speed
- Implement data usage indicators showing MB consumed per video and cumulative usage statistics
- Enable Progressive Web App features including offline access, home screen installation, and service worker caching
- Implement adaptive streaming that starts at lower quality and upgrades smoothly based on bandwidth
- Create mobile-optimized Data & Bandwidth settings panel with connection speed test and cellular/WiFi preferences

**User-visible outcome:** Users in low-bandwidth regions can watch videos with automatic quality optimization, track data consumption in real-time, install the app to their home screen, and access previously viewed content offline.
