# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix scrolling functionality on mobile devices and verify comprehensive mobile compatibility across all application features.

**Planned changes:**
- Diagnose and fix CSS overflow properties, touch-action directives, and viewport height calculations that prevent scrolling on mobile devices
- Ensure scrolling works correctly in all content areas including movie catalog, dialogs, profile pages, and navigation menus
- Test and verify touch input responsiveness for navigation, buttons, and interactive elements
- Validate Internet Identity authentication flow on mobile browsers
- Confirm video playback controls work with touch input
- Verify forms can be filled out and submitted on mobile devices
- Ensure dialogs and modals function correctly on mobile
- Check service worker compatibility to prevent app initialization blocking

**User-visible outcome:** Users can smoothly scroll through content on mobile devices using touch gestures, and all application features (navigation, authentication, video playback, forms, dialogs) work correctly on both iOS Safari and Android Chrome.
